 Megan is Admiral of Meetup Mates and Community Advocate at Tecknuovo. She has worked within the tech community as an organiser, cheerleader and general busy body for the past 3 and a half years, and couldn't imagine interacting with a more passionate and vibrant group of people. Nothing gives her more joy than bringing passionate people together. When she's not running between meetups, she can be found surrounded by too many dice or in a field wearing armour. She’s always open to board game recommendations!          | Kat is a marketing professional with several years of consultancy experience under her belt. Heading up the Marketing & Community Team at Tecknuovo Kat has quickly immersed herself in the tech Meetup scene and found her home at Meetup Mates, where everybody who’s interested in technology is welcome. When she’s not at work, Kat loves to spend time with her foodie friends finding interesting places to eat out. With a Masters in Classics, she loves to read historical fiction and spends as much time as possible in Italy.| Vic is Marketing and Community Coordinator at Tecknuovo. She moved to London at the end of 2019, joining the tech community following a few years’ experience in the consultancy world. Being brand new to the tech scene, the Meetup Mates crew ensured her first meetup event was enjoyable and removed any uncertainty – making her an advocate for why Meetup Mates is so important. In her free time, Vic enjoys spending time with friends, trying out new recipes and travelling.
