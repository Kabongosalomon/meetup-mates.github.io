All participants and members of the organisation are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

**The Quick Version**

Our Meetup Mates Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free Meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for our Slack channels, or any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the communityÂ at the discretion of the organisers.


**The Less Quick Version**

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.


If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the Community without notice.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organisers or First Mates immediately. 
Organising staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration any event we attend together. We value your participation.


We expect participants to follow these rules at any event we attend as a collective and Community-related social events.
