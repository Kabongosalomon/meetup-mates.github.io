According to the various laws and higher powers we have no control over, in order to legitimately ask you for any personal information (like your name, last name and email address), add you to the slack channel and e-mail you, we need to have a privacy policy. We also need you to read it, so you can definitely understand how we will be processing your data. 
This policy explains the way that we collect, use and protect your data as well as your choices with regard to your data.

We’ve tried to be as clear as we can be and to avoid unnecessary jargon, while including all the relevant information, but if anything doesn’t make sense, or you simply want to talk with a human about the data side of Meetup Mates, please email us (Margo and Dom) at meetupmatesldn@gmail.com. Thanks!

For registered members we also store username, first name, last name, email address; public discussions you may have on Meetup Mates Slack Channel; and a summary of decisions we’ve taken about you if we’ve reviewed your use of Meetup Mates Slack Channel for any reason (please refer to the Code of Conduct). Registered members may also have given us more data on sign up, such as their professional field, social media account link (used as a verification tool).

We store your email address to register you and contact you (if you have asked for email newsletters) and we store things such as IP address, cookies and device ID so that our systems recognise you if you return to Meetup Mates Website. 

We don’t require your address when you view Meetup Mates content or register with the site, and you can use Meetup Mates fully without providing it.

Subject to your permissions and choices (as explained later) we collect, store and process the data listed in this section. We believe we provide a useful service, and therefore have a legitimate interest in processing your data which benefits both Meetup Mates and you as a Meetup Mates user.

 <summary><b>We store the following data for all users, whether registered or not:</b>

So that we can add you to the slack channel, and to inform you about any changes to the community privacy policy, cookie policy and the code of conduct. If you choose to join Meetup Mates we also ask for your Twitter or LinkedIn Account so that we can check you’re a real person (to prevent ‘bots’ signing up). We won’t send you newsletters or mass email communications that you haven’t asked for, and we don’t sell your email address to anyone else.
Discussions that take place over email or via Private Messages between you and Meetup Mates in public channels – so that we have a record.
