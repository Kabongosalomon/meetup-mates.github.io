Meetup Mates is a community initiative geared towards the tech space. Our mission is simple: we want to help make tech meetups as open, accessible and fun for everyone!

Our community is run on Slack where we chat, get to know one another and share ideas, as well as where our meetup pre-meets are announced. From an hour before a meetup, we gather at a nearby venue and then attend the Meetup together as a group. The nerve-wracking days of attending meetups alone are over and we look forward to you joining the crew, matey!

_Meetup Mates is a Tecknuovo initiative and is run by Tecknuovo employees, however it remains a community platform and is open to anyone who wants to take part. We require personal data from our Mates to add them to the slack channel, however, as with all our community initiatives, this data will never be used by Tecknuovo for any sales activity and is held in a separate database. Please refer to our values and privacy policy if you want any more details on this._
