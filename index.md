Our goal is to help gather and connect like-minded people who want to join the meetup space, but prefer to attend with someone they already are familiar with. Meetup Mates is now doing a trial of the platform with the first **55 brave sailors** who help us test the waters.

We're hoping to launch the full version to everyone soon, so if you want to be the first on board, register your interest below:
