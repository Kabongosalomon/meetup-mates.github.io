Meetup Mates is an online community run on Slack, with the aim to connect people who want to attend more Meetups and make friends with people with similar interests. The Meetup Mates meet up an hour before a Meetup occurs and attend the Meetup as a group. The nerve-racking days of going to a Meetup by yourself are over!
