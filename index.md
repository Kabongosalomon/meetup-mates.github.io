Meetup Mates is an online community run on Slack, with the aim to connect people  who are looking to attend more Meetups in the technical space and make friends with people with similar interests. The Meetup Mates start gathering an hour before a Meetup occurs and attend it together as a group. The nerve-wracking days of going to Meetups by yourself are over!

Click the button below to register to Meetup Mates. We're looking forward to meeting you.
