Our goal is to help gather and connect like-minded people who want to join the meetup space, but prefer to attend with someone they already are familiar with. Meetup Mates is still a work in progress project, but we’re looking for **50 brave sailors** to test the waters with us, so if you’re up for it join the Slack group below.

Hurrah, we're outward bound! Yo Ho Ho!
